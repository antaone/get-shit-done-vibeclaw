<execution_branch_guard>
Before reading execution context, invoking another skill, or changing project state, run:
`node "$HOME/.claude/fvgsd/bin/fvgsd-tools.cjs" execution-branch ensure "ai-integration-phase" --runtime __FVGSD_RUNTIME__`

Parse the JSON response:
- Continue only when `allowed` is `true`.
- If `allowed` is `false`, stop and show its `message` and `hint`.
- If the hint names `fvgsd-vibe`, offer to route the requested command through that installed Vibe control surface instead of leaving the user with terminal-only steps.
- If `action` is `created` or `adopted`, tell the user which `branch` is active once.
- For `reused` or `inspected`, continue silently.
</execution_branch_guard>

<objective>
Create an AI design contract (AI-SPEC.md) for a phase involving AI system development.
Orchestrates fvgsd-framework-selector → fvgsd-ai-researcher → fvgsd-domain-researcher → fvgsd-eval-planner.
Flow: Select Framework → Research Docs → Research Domain → Design Eval Strategy → Done
