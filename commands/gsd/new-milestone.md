<execution_branch_guard>
Before reading execution context, invoking another skill, or changing project state, run:
`node "$HOME/.claude/fvgsd/bin/fvgsd-tools.cjs" execution-branch ensure "new-milestone" --runtime __FVGSD_RUNTIME__`

Parse the JSON response:
- Continue only when `allowed` is `true`.
- If `allowed` is `false`, stop and show its `message` and `hint`.
- If the hint names `fvgsd-vibe`, offer to route the requested command through that installed Vibe control surface instead of leaving the user with terminal-only steps.
- If `action` is `created` or `adopted`, tell the user which `branch` is active once.
- For `reused` or `inspected`, continue silently.
</execution_branch_guard>

<objective>
Start a new milestone: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

Brownfield equivalent of new-project. Project exists, PROJECT.md has history. Gathers "what's next", updates PROJECT.md, then runs requirements → roadmap cycle.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — updated with new milestone goals
- `.planning/research/` — domain research (optional, NEW features only)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements for this milestone
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure (continues numbering)
- `.planning/STATE.md` — reset for new milestone

**After:** `/fvgsd:plan-phase [N]` to start execution.

<context>
Milestone name: $ARGUMENTS (optional - will prompt if not provided)

Project and milestone context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init new-milestone`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks where subagents are used.
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, questioning, research, requirements, roadmap approval, commits).
