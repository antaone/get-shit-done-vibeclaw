<execution_branch_guard>
Before reading execution context, invoking another skill, or changing project state, run:
`node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" execution-branch ensure "audit-milestone" --runtime __VGSD_RUNTIME__`

Parse the JSON response:
- Continue only when `allowed` is `true`.
- If `allowed` is `false`, stop and show its `message` and `hint`.
- If `action` is `created` or `adopted`, tell the user which `branch` is active once.
- For `reused` or `inspected`, continue silently.
</execution_branch_guard>

<objective>
Verify milestone achieved its definition of done. Check requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, and end-to-end flows.

**This command IS the orchestrator.** Reads existing VERIFICATION.md files (phases already verified during execute-phase), aggregates tech debt and deferred gaps, then spawns integration checker for cross-phase wiring.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/audit-milestone.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Version: $ARGUMENTS (optional — defaults to current milestone)

Core planning files are resolved in-workflow (`init milestone-op`) and loaded only as needed.

**Completed Work:**
Glob: .planning/phases/*/*-SUMMARY.md
Glob: .planning/phases/*/*-VERIFICATION.md
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (scope determination, verification reading, integration check, requirements coverage, routing).
</process>
