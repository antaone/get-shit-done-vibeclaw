Before reading execution context, invoking another skill, or changing project state, run:
`node "$HOME/.claude/fvgsd/bin/fvgsd-tools.cjs" execution-branch ensure "settings" --runtime __FVGSD_RUNTIME__`

Parse the JSON response:
- Continue only when `allowed` is `true`.
- If `allowed` is `false`, stop and show its `message` and `hint`.
- If the hint names `fvgsd-vibe`, offer to route the requested command through that installed Vibe control surface instead of leaving the user with terminal-only steps.
- If `action` is `created` or `adopted`, tell the user which `branch` is active once.
- For `reused` or `inspected`, continue silently.
</execution_branch_guard>

<objective>
Interactive configuration of GSD workflow agents and model profile via multi-question prompt.

Routes to the settings workflow which handles:
- Config existence ensuring
- Current settings reading and parsing
- Interactive 5-question prompt (model, research, plan_check, verifier, branching)
- Config merging and writing
- Confirmation display with quick command references
